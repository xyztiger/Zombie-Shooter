# BoxHead

## A top-down zombie shooter game

This is a top-down zombie shooter game inspired by the popular web game Box Head.
The user will control a soldier and try to survive as long as they can by shooting
zombies that spawn.

Users of this project are looking for a lax and fun way to pass their time.

This project is interesting to me because:

- I was a big fan of the original Box Head game
- I believe that coding this project will be appropriately challenging
- I hope that I will create an application that I myself will enjoy using
