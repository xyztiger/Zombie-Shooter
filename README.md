# BoxHead

## A top-down zombie shooter game

This is a top-down zombie shooter game inspired by the popular web game Box Head.
The user will control a soldier and try to survive as long as they can by shooting
zombies that spawn.

Users of this project are looking for a lax and fun way to pass their time.

This project is interesting to me because:

- I was a big fan of the original Box Head game
- I believe that coding this project will be appropriately challenging
- I hope that I will create an application that I myself will enjoy using

## Phase 4: Task 2
- My Player class is robust in that the move() method will throw a BorderException if the player attempts to move
  outside the stage. This exception is handled by the Game class which will print out a message to the system and
  not allow the player to move out the stage.
- The tests for the move() method and exception handling is included in the PlayerTest class.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- One problem is that my panels contained too much duplicate code. I fixed this by creating an abstract class called
  ButtonPanel which implements methods common to all my panels that have buttons. All my panels which have buttons now 
  extend the ButtonPanel class, which drastically reduced duplicate code. This was partially done in Phase 3.
- Another problem is that there was poor cohesion in my Game class. This class had too many functionalities. I fixed
  this by creating two separate classes called the LoadPanel and QuitPanel, which implement the load game and save/quit
  game features that were both originally methods within the Game class. Now the Game class has less logic and focuses
  more on taking in user input.
